Title: Simulation of deterministic and stochastic biochemical reaction
        networks using Petri Nets
Author: Roberto Bertolusso and Marek Kimmel
Maintainer: Roberto Bertolusso <rbertolusso@rice.edu>
Description: 
  bioPN is a package suited to perform simulation of deterministic and stochastic systems of biochemical reaction
  networks.
  Models are defined using a subset of Petri Nets, in a way that is close at how chemical reactions
  are defined.
  For deterministic solutions, bioPN creates the associated system of differential equations "on the fly", and
  solves it with a Runge Kutta Dormand Prince 45 explicit algorithm.
  For stochastic solutions, bioPN offers variants of Gillespie algorithm, or SSA.
  For hybrid deterministic/stochastic,
  it employs the Haseltine and Rawlings algorithm, that partitions the system in fast and slow reactions.
  bioPN algorithms are developed in C to achieve adequate performance.
